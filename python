""" Tara is a content manager who needs to perform case conversions for various pieces of text and save the results in a structured manner.



She requires a program to take a user's input string, save it in a file, and then retrieve and display the string in both upper-case and lower-case versions. Help her achieve this task efficiently.



File Name: text_file.txt

Input format :
The input consists of a single line containing a string provided by the user.

Output format :
The first line displays the original string read from the file in the format: "Original String: {original_string}".

The second line displays the upper-case version of the original string in the format: "Upper-Case String: {upper_case_string}".

The third line displays the lower-case version of the original string in the format: "Lower-Case String: {lower_case_string}"."""

# Step 1: Get a string from the user
user_string = input()

# Step 2: Save the string to a file
with open("text_file.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(user_string)

# Step 3: Read the file and display the original, upper-case, and lower-case strings
with open("text_file.txt", "r") as file:
    saved_string = file.read()

print("Original String:", saved_string)
print("Upper-Case String:", saved_string.upper())
print("Lower-Case String:", saved_string.lower())
